      This is a Mustache template that supports the following variables:
        * `inputs` (the inputs given to the action)
        * `comment` (an object of the comment that was created)
        * `totalDays` (`days_until_warning` + `days_until_unassign`)
        * `env` (`process.env`, anything you pass to the action via `env`)
    default: >-
      This issue [has been assigned]({{ comment.html_url }}) to @{{ comment.user.login }}!

      It will become unassigned if it isn't closed within {{ totalDays }} days. A maintainer can also add the **{{ inputs.pin_label }}** label to prevent it from being unassigned.
  warning_comment:
    description: >
      The comment posted to warn a user that the issue will become unassigned.
      This is a Mustache template that supports the following variables:
        * `user` (the user that was assigned)
        * `inputs` (the inputs given to the action)
        * `env` (`process.env`, anything you pass to the action via `env`)
    default: >-
      @{{ assignee.login }}, this issue hasn't had any activity in {{ inputs.days_until_warning }} days. It will become unassigned in {{ inputs.days_until_unassign }} days to make room for someone else to contribute.
